- 👋 Hi, I’m @devinship
- 👀 I’m interested in becoming a full-stack developer, and would like to start with front-end development. I have some experience with HTML and CSS, but definitely a noob.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning front-end development via the Odin Project and considering a Coursera FED cert class.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any front-end project to learn from a veteran developer(s).
- 📫 I can be reached via my email: devinship@gmail.com
